# Lazarus_IDE_AddIns
Examples and helpers for the Lazarus IDE

This add-in is a first shot, that is working for me (see folder "doc").
But it still has limitations and restrictions :
- No multi-editor-window support
- No reinitialization support
- Tabs on left or on right are not being displayed correctly
- Font, dimensions and colors are fixed in source code
- Changing settings for the pages in tools-options requires restarting of lazarus
- Changing settings for the pages in tools-options may also lead to unexpected behavior
